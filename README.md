# ZeppGolf

## Overview

ZeppGolf is a data analysis tool and interactive dashboard designed to analyze golf swing data, identify relationships between various swing metrics and scores, and provide feature ranking, visualization, and model-based evaluation. The repository includes both a command-line analysis script (`main.py`) and an interactive dashboard built with Streamlit (`streamlit_app.py` and `dashboard.py`).

## Features

- **Golf Score Analysis Dashboard:** Visualize and explore golf swing data interactively.
- **Feature Ranking:** Rank features by variance, correlation with score, or model importance.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Train regression models to predict scores and evaluate improvement over baseline methods.
- **Data Visualization:** 
  - Score distribution plots
  - Individual feature vs. score plots
  - Pairwise feature relationship plots
  - Correlation heatmaps
  - Time-series progression of scores
- **Downloadable Analysis:** Export analysis results (CSV).
- **Advanced Analysis:** Explore custom feature combinations and trends.

## File Structure

- `main.py` - Main script for batch analysis and feature ranking.
- `streamlit_app.py` - Streamlit dashboard for interactive exploration.
- `dashboard.py` - Alternative dashboard interface (Streamlit).
- `wrangle.py` - Data wrangling utility functions.
- Other supporting modules for plotting, modeling, and configuration.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Recommended: Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Dependencies

Install required packages (you may need to adapt if your environment differs):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Typical dependencies include:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- scikit-learn
- streamlit
- plotly

## Usage

### 1. Command-Line Analysis

Run the main analysis script to process your golf data and output summary statistics, feature rankings, and plots.

```bash
python main.py --db_path path/to/your/database.db --output_dir results/ --rank_by variance --n_features 10 --run_model
```

**Arguments:**
- `--db_path` : Path to SQLite database file containing golf swing data.
- `--output_dir` : Directory to save output results/plots.
- `--rank_by` : Feature ranking method: `variance`, `correlation`, or `importance`.
- `--n_features` : Number of top features to analyze.
- `--run_model` : If provided, trains and evaluates a regression model.

### 2. Interactive Dashboard

Launch the dashboard to interactively explore and analyze your data.

```bash
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```
or
```bash
streamlit run dashboard.py
```

**Features:**
- Upload a SQLite `.db` file or use a default data path.
- Configure ranking method and analysis options in the sidebar.
- Explore data overview, feature ranking, and visualizations in tabs.
- Download CSV summaries of your analysis.

## Example Workflow

1. **Upload Data:** Use the sidebar to upload your `.db` file or set the path.
2. **Configure Analysis:** Choose how to rank features, number of top features, and whether to skip high variance outliers.
3. **Explore Results:** 
    - View dataset information, score distribution, and progression over time.
    - Analyze top features using variance, correlation, or model importance.
    - Visualize feature relationships and advanced custom analysis.

## Output

- **Plots**: Saved to the output directory (if using CLI), or displayed in the dashboard.
- **CSV Files**: Summary statistics and feature rankings for further analysis.
- **Model Metrics**: MAE and improvement over baseline for score prediction.

## Customization

- Modify configuration in `config.py` to set default paths and analysis parameters.
- Extend `wrangle.py` for custom data processing needs.
